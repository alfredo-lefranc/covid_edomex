Analysis of delays in death reports due to Covid-19 in the State of Mexico

Project for the Applied Research class at ITAM, taught by Emilio Fern√°ndez and Tiago Tavares in the fall semester of 2020.

#### Data
The figures for cases and deaths published by the Secretariat of Public Health are used. In these data, the date of death may not be defined if the patient is still alive or if the death has not been reported. For this reason, it is possible to identify the days of delay in the reports by comparing the information reported on different days.

#### Software
The analysis is carried out with Stata, except for the estimates of the evolution of the pandemic with the SIR model, which were done in Python.
